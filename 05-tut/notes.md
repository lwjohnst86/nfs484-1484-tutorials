# Goals + objectives for fifth tutorial #
  
* Get to know three students
    * Which would you more likely choose: a house or a condo?
    * What is your dream vacation?
    * Sushi or italian?
* Give out ticket out the door; need to complete it to leave.
    * Helps us (me) to get better, find out what works, what doesn't
      work.
* Try to use their names in the class if they ask a question
* Do first tips slide before going into groups.
* Will do small groups + class discussion
    * Explain why we are still going to do groups:
        - Eventually they will need to work in a group for final grad assignment
        - Doing groups now will help all of you get comfortable with
          each other, enough to hopefully be able to work with anyone
          in this room.
        - I will be forming the groups for the final assignment
          (depending on attendance)... It will be random (using cards
          [^cards]).  This is how it is often like in the "real" world
          so you have to learn to work with each other's strengths and
          weaknesses, learning to delegate tasks.
        - The groups will be approximately the same size as how we do
          it in the tutorial... One MSc to 3 or 4 MPH students.  To
          get different perspectives, strengths, and weaknesses.
* Goal: To get them to quickly form groups and answer the questions.
  To get them to work together to answer the questions.  Get them to
  delegate tasks (speaker[^sp] and a person to "officially" write down
  answers)

[^cards]: I will probably use cards to randomize people.  I'll use the
    suit of the card to determine group.  Given the small number of
    MSc/PhD students, likely they will form the basis of the groups
    (ie. there will be only four cards for the four grad students).
    Then I will give out the cards and each card will dictate the
    group.

[^sp]: Explain that the speaker is the "official" person to do the
    talking. Anyone can talk but the speakers are the ones that need
    to talk their results.  I may not have them assign speakers. 

# Acivities #

* Split into groups, complete as many questions as they can in 20
  minutes.
* After that we will go over each of the questions.
    * Go over the possible answers to the questions
    * Ask how they did with their own answers, what was different,
      etc.
* Hand out and get back the tickets out the door (5min before end of class)

# Thoughts on how tutorial went #

I thought it went well, splitting into groups and then going over the
questions as a class.  However...

* I noticed that the grad students focus a lot on how crappy the
  methods are, how the figures and tables don't make sense, how the
  methods can be confusing and not always clear.
* It's really important that there is a background and that the
  figs/methods/tables are logical and make sense
* I'm not sure, but the MPH students seem to be struggling with the
  practice sets. But! Its hard to determine as there are only 4 MSc
  students.

I handed out the ticket out the door for feedback.
