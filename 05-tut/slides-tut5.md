# Tips: How to read correlations

The $r$ number gives info on how related the two values are, while the
plus or minus indicate direction.  $P$-value determines significance.

Smaller the $r$, the greater the dispersion of the data.  Generally
only need to know direction and significance.

# Study

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a colon-specific
carciongen, DMH, or saline as a control group.

DMH has a stimulating effect on cell proliferation that lasts for a
number of weeks.

Rats were subsequently fed either a high sucrose diet (46g/kg) or a
high corn starch diet (46g/kg) for 30 days or 105 days.

At the end of the 30 or 105 days of feeding, a series of indices of
cecal function were evaluated, as summarized in Table 1.

As well, the cecal and fecal content of total and individual SCFAs
were evaluated (Figure 1,2, and Table 2).

# Study, con't

In these same rats, the proliferative activity of cells in the rectal
mucosa was assessed by measuring the number of 3H-thymidine-labelled
cells (Figure 3).

Proliferative activity in the colon was expressed as the number of
labeled cells (LC)/crypt.

By linear regression analysis, rectal proliferation data was then
compared to variations in cecal SCFAs at 105 days after feeding diets
(Table 3).

# Question 1

Describe the effects of sucrose and starch-rich diets on cecal
function (Table 1), cecal and fecal concentrations of SCFAs (Figures 1
& 2, and Table 2). (5)

# Q2, con't

Discuss a mechanism to explain why the cecal and fecal content of
total and individual SCFAs may differ in rats fed sucrose and
starch-rich diets for 105 days? (10)

\vspace{1.5cm}

# Q2, con't

**Possible A:**

\pause

**Digestion/Absorption differences:**

Sucrose is a simple sugar and would have very efficient digestion &
absorption.

\pause

Starch is a complex polysaccharide, has a slower digestion process and
would reach the colon allowing for greater bacterial fermentation and
greater production of SCFA (Fig 1: $\uparrow$ total production of
SCFAs at 30 & 105d, Table 1: $\downarrow$ pH on starch at 105 d )

# Q2, con't

**Differences in Colonic bacterial populations:**

\pause

Starch feeding results in significant differences in proportion of
individual SCFAs produced in cecum at 105 days suggesting the
stimulation of specific bacterial populations at this time. (Table 2)

\pause

By 105 days, bacteria are very efficient at producing SCFA (see
sig. $\downarrow$ pH at this time) and the absorptive capacitiy of the
cecum has been exceeded, resulting in significant excretion of SCFAs
in feces (Fig 2).

# Q3a

Describe the effects of sucrose and starch-rich diets on proliferative
activity in the rectal mucosa of control and DMH-treated rats fed the
diets for 30 and 105 days (Figure 3) (5)

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/figure3}

# Q3b

Describe the correlations between colonic proliferative activity in
rats and SCFA concentrations in rats fed sucrose and starch-rich diets
for 105d (Table 3). (5)

# Q4

Based on all of the data presented, discuss a mechanism for the effect
of dietary carbohydrates on colonic proliferative activity? (10).

\pause

First, use the diagram to work through what is going on.

# Q4, Long-term (Chronic) feeding

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth, page=2, angle=270]{images/mechanism}

# Q4, con't

**Possible A:**

\pause

High starch diet vs high sucrose diet $\rightarrow$ $\uparrow$ SCFA
production in the gut (Fig. 1)

\pause

SCFA’s $\downarrow$ the pH of the gut (Table 1) and may in turn affect
microfloral balance and $\uparrow$ in beneficial, protective
bacteria (Table 2 shows different proportions of SCFA)

\pause

Supported in table 3 showing a significant positive
correlation between cecal pH and proliferative activity.

# Q4, con't

\pause

High starch diet = different proportions of SCFAs in cecum
(fig. 1, table 2)

\pause

High starch diet = different proportions of SCFAs in cecum
$\uparrow$ Butyrate concentration & proportion and $\downarrow$
proportion of acetate & acetate:butyrate ratio (Table 2)

\pause

High starch diet = different proportions of SCFAs in cecum
Butyrate concentration and percentage are both significantly
negatively correlated with proliferative activity in the rectum (Table
3).

# Q4, con't

Butyrate is preferred energy source for colon; helps repair cells and
improve colonocyte maintenance. *(Note: this information wasn’t given
so we wouldn't expect it in the answer)*

\pause

High starch diet = different proportions of SCFAs in cecum
SCFA’s (esp. butyrate) may inhibit colon cancer by inhibiting cell
proliferation (Figure 3) *(Can’t say this conclusively as no
difference in rectal proliferation between saline and DMH-treated
groups)*

# Q5

Discuss the purpose of 2 experimental periods in the study (i.e. 30d & 105d)

**Possible A:**

Adaptation (how long does it take to see changes in bacterial
populations?)

Acute vs chronic effects

A number of answers may be given as long as they are logical and can
be substantiated with data.
