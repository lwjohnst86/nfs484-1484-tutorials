# Goals + objectives for third tutorial #
  
* Get to know three students
* Remind them about the grades, that you still need to try (you don't
  try, you still fail)
* Quickly go through the tips slide. Mention they can go over it. If
  they have questions about the tips slide, email me. Otherwise
  **email Carly**
* Objective:
    * Again, to get them to understand what is going on. We can answer
      the questions if there is time.

# Acivities #

* 3 main groups: one on study 1, one on study 2, one on study 3
    * 20 / 3 = 7 / 2 = ~3-4
    * Two groups will do study 1, two on study 2, two on study 3 (6
      groups total)
    * Give them some time to quickly scan the assignment and develop
      their own concept
          * Time: 5 minutes
    * Group them by counts (1 to 6): 
        * 1, 2 -> study 1
        * 3, 4 -> study 2
        * 5, 6 -> study 3
    * Time: 20 minutes

* Then mix them up again, bringing those from each study into one
  group to merge findings and teach each other.
    * This tutorial:
        * Hand out blank pieces of paper to develop concept
        * Mention I would like to collect them at end, to help me
          improve whether I am doing this right
    * Group by counting:
        * In each group that did study {1,2,3} -> 1 to 6
    * Assign a speaker
    * Assign someone who develops the concept model
    * Time: 25 minutes
    
* Discussion time, all speakers talk about their concept. Write on
  VUE
    * What does it all mean? Any questions? Thoughts?
    * Go over the example questions if there is time.

* Get feedback from the three students (positive + improvement)

# Thoughts on how tutorial went #

This tutorial didn't go nearly as well as I had hoped. I would say the
biggest/hardest part was the length of the practice set. It was 3
studies long. I had wanted to do more talking/discussing at the end,
but there wasn't enough time. I also had wanted to use the VUE program
to sorta draw out what is going on, but VUE doesn't do want I had in
mind. So it was kinda a failure there. Plus the tips slides took up
some time there.

Some suggestions for next tutorial were:

> "Everyone do the describe type questions, so everyone is prepared"

> "Do more discussion as a group"

> "Describe how I would go about answering the questions/doing the
> assignment"

So, for next tutorial, go over the assignment as a group, with me
detailing how I would do it.
