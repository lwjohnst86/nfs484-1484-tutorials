# Background:

* Cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in North America,
  is a multifactorial condition influenced by metabolic and dietary
  differences between individuals—particularly differences that
  modulate plasma cholesterol levels.

* Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is characterized by the development of
  atherosclerotic lesions in blood vessels resulting from the
  deposition of cholesterol and lipids from plasma into arterial
  walls.

* These lesions compromise the function of arteries and cause
  obstructions that reduce blood flow to important organs such as the
  heart—eventually resulting in myocardial infarction and possibly
  death.

# Background, con't

* Plasma cholesterol is carried by various lipoprotein particles. For
  instance, elevated, fasting plasma concentrations of cholesterol
  carried by very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density
  lipoprotein (LDL) particles are related to an increased risk of CVD
  as they deliver cholesterol and lipids of dietary origin to arterial
  walls after being secreted by the liver.

* Conversely, an elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
  concentration is related to a reduced risk of CVD as it removes
  cholesterol and lipids from plasma and arterial walls.

* Cholesterol carried by HDL is eventually absorbed by the liver, and
  then excreted.

# Background, con't

* Lipoproteins frequently donate or accept lipids from each other.
  For instance, HDL particles can be modified in circulation by
  various enzymes that influence the amount of lipid and cholesterol
  they carry.

* Such changes can destabilize the HDL particle resulting in its
  destruction, or can sometimes convert the HDL into larger or smaller
  particles.

* As HDL particles increase in size they become much less
  anti-atherogenic.


# Key points from Background

* CVD and arterial wall lesions from cholesterol and lipids, reducing
  blood flow

* $\uparrow$ VLDL and LDL, secreted by liver, $\uparrow$ risk of CVD

* $\uparrow$ HDL, absorbed by liver, $\downarrow$ risk of CVD

* Cholesterol/lipids can move between Lipoproteins via enzymes,
  $\uparrow$ or $\downarrow$ their size (e.g. HDL $\rightarrow$ LDL,
  vice versa)

* $\uparrow$ HDL size, $\uparrow$ risk of CVD

# Study 1

* Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is secreted into circulation
  where it binds HDL particles, and influences the ability of HDL to
  accept lipids and cholesterol from VLDL particles.

* It is unknown what effects PLTP has on plasma cholesterol and HDL
  metabolism.

* Using transgenic technology, the human PLTP gene was inserted into
  the genome of mice.

* Groups of transgenic and wildtype (i.e. not expressing human PLTP)
  mice were fed normal rodent chow (a low-fat, high-fibre diet) or a
  high-fat diet for 10 weeks.

# Study 1, con't

* Fasting plasma cholesterol concentrations were then determined. The
  size of the HDL particles present in the fasting samples were also
  measured.

* Lastly, an in vitro experiment was conducted in which the
  plasma of wildtype mice fed rodent chow was incubated with three
  different concentrations of purified human PLTP.

* The percentage of original HDL particles remaining in the plasma
  were monitored over 800 minutes.

# Key points from Study 1

* PLTP binds HDL, regulate acceptance of lipids/cholesterol, but
  unknown how plasma levels are affected

* 2 mice by 2 diet design, 10 weeks

* Fasting cholesterol \[conc\] and size

* in vitro, wildtype incubated with 3 \[conc\] of PLTP

* HDL particles monitored over 800 minutes

# Question 1, Study 1

Describe the effects of human PLTP expression on total, HDL, and
VLDL/LDL cholesterol concentrations and HDL particle size under chow
and high-fat diet conditions in Table 1. (3/50 marks)

# Question 2, Study 1

Describe the effect that PLTP concentration has on the HDL content
of serum samples in vitro (Figure 1). (1/50 marks)

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/figure1}

# Question 3, Study 1

Using all of the information presented in Study 1 and the
background, discuss how PLTP and diet influence plasma cholesterol
concentrations. In your answer speculate as to how these effects may
influence risk of developing atherosclerotic lesions. (5/50 marks)

\pause

Possible A:

* PLTP in transgenic mice $\downarrow$ \[HDL\] and $\uparrow$ HDL size
  compared to wildtype mice regardless of diet (Table 1)

\pause

* High-fat diet $\uparrow$ \[total cholesterol\] and \[LDL/VLDL\],
  regardless of PLTP, but > in transgenic mice (Table 1)

\pause

* $\uparrow$ PLTP $\downarrow$ # of HDL particles (Figure 1)

# Question 3, con't

* Background and Figure 1, PLTP likely transfers lipids/cholesterol to
  HDL, $\uparrow$ size in dose-dependent manner

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth, angle=270]{images/q3}

# Question 3, con't

* Conclude that \[HDL\] modulated by PLTP, while effect of diet on
  \[LDL/VLDL/total cholesterol\] modified by PLTP

\pause

Taken together in the big picture/context of info in background?

# Question 3, con't

We can hypothesize that:

* High-fat diet may $\uparrow$ lesions as it
  $\uparrow$ \[VLDL/LDL\], which may $\uparrow$ plasma
  lipids/cholesterol (Background)

\pause

* PLTP may $\uparrow$ lesions as it $\downarrow$ \[HDL\] and size,
  which $\downarrow$ cholesterol/lipid clearance, which $\uparrow$
  plasma lipids/cholesterol (Background)

\pause

* Combined, high-fat diet + PLTP $\uparrow$ lesions > each
  independently

# Study 2

* Dietary recommendations to reduce fat consumption are frequently
  made to patients with suspected CVD, or pre-existing atherosclerotic
  lesions.

* The primary objective of this study was to examine the influence of
  PLTP activity on pre-existing disease.

* Transgenic mice were developed that carried an inducible form of the
  human PLTP gene.

* The gene was designed to only be expressed, or “induced”, in the
  presence of a drug called doxycycline which does not independently
  influence plasma cholesterol.

* Littermates not carrying this gene were also obtained to act as
  controls.

# Study 2, con't

* Control and inducible (indPLTP) animals were placed on a high-fat
  diet for 9 weeks, after which all animals were placed on a chow diet.

* Groups of both control and indPLTP mice were subjected to either
  Treatment A or Treatment B.

* In Treatment A, the mice consumed a chow diet and received
  doxycycline for two weeks (11A), and were then sacrificed to examine
  fasting plasma cholesterol concentrations, atherosclerotic lesion
  size, and PLTP activity (i.e. the capacity of PLTP to perform its
  transfer function).

* In Treatment B, animals consumed a chow diet for two weeks in the
  absence of doxycycline (11B), and then received chow and doxycycline
  for an additional 6 weeks before being sacrificed (17B).

# Key points from Study 2

* Transgenic mice have inducible form of PLTP, in presence of
  doxycycline

* Treatment A, chow and doxycycline for two weeks, then measured
  \[chol\], lesion size, PLTP activity (acute condition)

* Treatment B, chow without doxycycline for two weeks, then chow and
  doxycycline for 6 weeks (chronic condition)

# Question 4, Study 2

Describe the statistically significant results presented in
Table 2. (3/50 marks)

\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/table2}

# Question 5, Study 2

Describe how plasma PLTP activity changed over the course of the
experiment \[in Figure 3\]. (2/50 marks)

\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/figure3}

# Question 6, Study 2

Describe the effects of PLTP expression on atherosclerotic lesion size
in Figure \[4\]. (2/50 marks)

\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/figure4}

# Question 7, Study 2

Discuss how PLTP activity in Study 2 influenced plasma cholesterol
concentrations and atherosclerotic lesion size in response to dietary
change. (5/50 marks)

Possible A:  Break it down.  What does PLTP do after induction?

\pause

* Inducing PLTP $\downarrow$ HDL (Table 2), $\uparrow$ lesions (Figure
  4), regardless of acute or chronic diet change.  What does acute
  diet change do to control mice?

\pause

* Acute diet change at 9 weeks has no effect on lesion area (Figure
  4), or on HDL, but does change VLDL/LDL (Table 2) in control
  mice.  What does acute diet change do to indPLTP mice?

# Question 7, con't

* Acute diet change at 9 weeks $\downarrow$ VLDL/LDL, > baseline, but
  not as much as control in indPLTP (Table 2).  Which suggests?
  \pause  Both high-fat and PLTP $\uparrow$ VLDL/LDL.  What about for
  chronic diet change to both mice groups?

\pause

* Chronic diet change in controls no change in VLDL/LDL from acute
  (Table 2), but lower lesion size though not as much as baseline
  (Figure 4).  Chronic diet change in indPLTP is no different than
  acute change.  What does this all mean for lesion size?

\pause

* $\uparrow$ VLDL/LDL + $\uparrow$ PLTP $\rightarrow$ $\downarrow$ HDL
  leads to > lesion size compared to high-fat diet alone.  Changing
  diet doesn't improve lesion size.  Chronic diet change without PLTP
  improves lesion size, but not as much as baseline.

# Question 8, Study 2

Drawing on all of the information presented in this assignment up to
this point, propose a comprehensive mechanism explaining differences
in lesion size observed in Study 2.  Would you expect the same results
if animals in Study 2 were maintained on a chow diet throughout the
entire study?

Possible A: Answer first part and break it down using all info
(i.e. background).  How does diet play a role, in this case high-fat
diet?

\pause

* High-fat diet promotes lesions, $\uparrow$ VLDL/LDL, but no effect
  on HDL (Study 2), likely because of > lipid intake, promoting
  lipid/cholesterol into arterial wall, though clearance is constant
  (Background).  Now, how about acute diet change to normal-fat diet?

# Question 8, con't

* Acute diet change reduces lipid intake, $\downarrow$ VLDL/LDL to
  baseline levels in control mice (Study 2), thus < lipids into
  arterial wall as lipid intake balances clearance (Background).  How
  about chronic diet change?

\pause

* Chronic diet change slowly reverses lesion size (Study 2) as HDL
  clearance of lipids continues.  Ok, now how about PLTP in diet
  change?

# Question 8, con't

* With $\uparrow$ PLTP activity, diet change how no effect on lesion
  size, > VLDL/LDL compared to baseline, $\downarrow$ HDL (Study 2),
  because PLTP converts small HDL into larger HDL with >
  lipids/cholesterol, reducing lipid clearance (Study 1 and
  Background).  > lipid intake + < lipid clearance = > lesions.
  \pause Good, now next part of question 8: *Would you expect the same
  results if animals in Study 2 were maintained on a chow diet
  throughout the entire study?*

# Question 8, con't

* If normal mice had stayed on standard chow, lesions would =
  baseline.  If indPLTP had stayed on standard chow, lesions would
  $\uparrow$ after PLTP induction, because of $\downarrow$ HDL,
  leading to < clearance, thus > lipids creating lesions.

* Lesion size would not be as large as following high-fat diet
  $\rightarrow$ $\uparrow$ VLDL/LDL from diet, as PLTP does not
  influence VLDL/LDL (Study 1)

# Study 3

* Amongst CVD patients, large differences in plasma PLTP activity
  exist between individuals presumably due to genetic variability.

* In order to examine how such variability may influence CVD outcome,
  5000 individuals with confirmed atherosclerotic lesions of similar
  size and position were continually monitored for the incidence of
  death from myocardial infarction over almost 8 years of follow-up.

* The proportion of patients surviving after 400 weeks was examined by
  quartile grouping of PLTP activity.

# Study 3, con't

* Quartile groupings (Q1-4) were compiled by sorting subjects into
  four groups based on their plasma PLTP activity.

* Q1 contains those individuals with the lowest PLTP activity and
  looks at their survival over time. Q4 contains those individuals
  with the highest PLTP activity, and examines their survival over
  time.

* Therefore, as quartile grouping increases so does the plasma PLTP
  activity of the individuals who are found in the grouping.

# Key points from Study 3

* Range of PLTP activity between individuals due to genes

* Follow individuals until cardiac event

* Quartiles of PLTP activity

* Q1 = lowest PLTP, Q4 = highest

# Question 9, Study 3

Describe the effect of plasma PLTP activity on cardiac survival
(1/50).

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{images/figure5}

# Question 10, Study 3

Using all of the information presented in this assignment, explain how
differences in plasma PLTP activity may influence cardiac survival in
individuals with pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions. (7/50 marks)

Break it down.  Good idea to make a diagram for yourself,
to help answer the question.

\pause

# Question 10, con't

Possible A: This answer is similar to previous questions.  One step at
a time.  What does PLTP do?

\pause

* PLTP $\uparrow$ conversion of small HDL (assist clearance) to large
  HDL (don't assist clearance as much), which enhances incorporation of
  lipids into arterial wall, $\uparrow$ lesions (Study 1 and
  Background).  Ok, how does PLTP react to type of diet?

\pause

* PLTP + high-fat diet $\uparrow$ VLDL/LDL (Study 1), $\uparrow$
  lesion size (Study 2) than high-fat diet alone as increased lipids
  from VLDL/LDL and lower clearance from HDL leads to incorporation
  into arterial wall.  I.e. individuals with high PLTP are similar to
  mice in Study 2.  And in the context of Study 3?

# Question 10, con't

* In Study 3, dose-response between PLTP activity and cardiac death,
  i.e. PLTP activity likely influences functioning HDL.  Gene
  differences lead to differing levels of HDL, lipid clearance, and
  lesion development.  As lesions grow, $\downarrow$ blood flow,
  i.e. to the heart, $\rightarrow$ myocardial infarction + death.

* So, individuals with > PLTP have > risk of cardiac event and death. 

# Question 11, Study 3

If two individuals asked your advice on how to decrease their chance
of dying from a myocardial infarction, what dietary advice would you
give? What advice would you give if you knew that they exhibited
different plasma PLTP activity (high vs. low)? Would your advice
change if you knew that they possessed pre-existing atherosclerotic
lesions? Draw only on all of the information presented in the
assignment, and clearly explain the reasons for your advice. (14/50
marks)

Possible A:  There are several ways to answer this.  Which ever answer
you give, give justification.
