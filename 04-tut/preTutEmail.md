Hey everyone,

Thanks for participating in the last tutorial. I feel that that practice set was too big (and too complex) for so little time we had during the tutorial. Sooo, given the time constraints, the suggestions of many of you, and the fact that your assignment will be due the Thursday after next tutorial (Oct. 9th), we will be going over the practice assignment a bit differently in the next tutorial.

What I am thinking (and many of you want) is to go through the practice from the start as one big group discussion.  We'll try to tackle each question to help you with your assignment and I'll go over how I would prepare to answer the questions (as well as answering them).  Hopefully this would give you a better idea on what we are looking for.

In order for everyone to benefit the most from this tutorial, please do at least the describe questions.

I'll also try to answer some questions about the assignment at the next tutorial.  So bring any questions you may have!

Enjoy the rest of the week + the weekend!

Luke
