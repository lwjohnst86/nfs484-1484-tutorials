Hi everyone,

It was a pleasure meeting everyone in the first tutorial. I hope to be able to know each of your names by the end, but it may take some time so forgive me!

In the next tutorial, we will start to go over how a typical assignment/exam is formatted and structured. We will be using a practice set, and to get the most out of the tutorial as well as contribute to the group/pairs I *strongly* suggest that you prepare beforehand. At least to the point where you have read the tutorial 2 practice set.

Based on those pieces of paper I got everyone to write on, there were a few undergrads in the group. Given that this is a graduate tutorial, you may not get the most out of compared it to the undergrad tutorials. But! If you really want to come to the grad tutorials, you are more than welcome! :)

Also, given everyone was there at 9am and not according to UofT time, I am hoping we can continue starting at 9am to get the most out of the tutorial!

Anywho, see everyone next Tuesday at 9am!

Luke
