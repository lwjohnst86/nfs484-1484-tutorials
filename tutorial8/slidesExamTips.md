# Tips --- Before the exam

* **Practice using past exams**
* Flow of exam is same as assignment
* Open book --- usually don't need to use the notes as exam is for the
  most part standalone
* Not expected to have detailed knowledge outside content of the
  course, only knowledge typically obtained by 4th year

# Tips --- Before the exam

* The level and depth of the answer we are looking for is reflected in
  the answer key of the past exams
* Articles covered in class are meant to demonstrate principles to
  help develop the thinking necessary for working through the exams,
  don't need to know the study details, etc
* Similarly for lecture notes, they are there for the concepts and the
  understanding, not necessary to memorize; exams are typically standalone
  
# Tips --- In the exam

* Don't panic!!
* Briefly scan exam
* Tie in metabolic pathways 
* Don't take too long reading the exam/wait too long before writing
  your answers
* Answer each study consecutively
* Working through each question will help formulate the answers for
  the next questions

# Tips --- In the exam

* If you don't understand a *word*, ask for clarification
* Each figure/table is there for a reason
* Everything was include for a reason
* Bullet points are allowed, as long as the thought process is clear
  and logical and that the bullets connect with one another
  (e.g. point A to B to C, etc)
* Don't need to include p-values, just significance and direction
* Use short-hand to write faster (e.g. $\uparrow$ to mean increase,
  '>' to mean greater than, etc.)

# Tips --- In the exam

* Length of answer does not = higher mark!  Longer answers often
  reflect lack of focus/bigger hand-writing
* Include the source of data (e.g. "It was found to be higher (Table 1)")
* Don't just randomly write answers, or what you think are answers!
  Take the time to think through the question, formulate a logical
  answer, then write.  Randomly writing may in fact reduce your mark
  as it will show lack of logic and focus.  Take your time and think
  through the answers
* Include all the variables (for most of the questions) in your answer.
* The flow and logic of your answer is very important and may often
  increase your mark even if the answer isn't exactly what we are
  looking for
