# Goals + objectives for eighth tutorial #
  
* Get to know six students
    * If you could choose any animal as a pet, which would you choose?
    * Which of the holidays is your favorite?
    * Do you have any brothers or sisters? Are you the oldest? Have
      you ever wanted some (if not)?
    * Do you have a favorite book or book series?
    * If you could have any superpower, what would you have?
    * Do you play video games? Board games? Card games? If so, which
      game do you like best?
* Try to use their names in the class if they ask a question
* Split their groups before doing tips slide
* Go over tips slide
* Go over past midterm slides
* Goal: To get them discussing and thinking about the answers to the
  questions + writing them down. I'll not be showing the answers, but
  will give them the answers after class (I think they have access to
  them already).  Explain the point isn't to know the answers, but
  actually to just get into the mode of thinking like you are in the
  exam.

# Acivities #

* Split into groups right away
* Go through study description + the description questions with
  everyone, then get them to go into groups and work through the
  discussion questions
* Get them to draw their own concept maps as a group
* After some time, get everyone to discuss the questions, what others
  got etc
* Repeatedly do: introduce questions, get them to try, then go over answers.
    * Ask how they did with their own answers, what was different,
      etc.
