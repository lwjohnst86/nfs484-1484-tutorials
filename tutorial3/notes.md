# Goals + objectives for second tutorial #
  
* Get to know three students
* Remind them about the grades, that you still need to try (you don't
  try, you still fail)
* Quickly go through the tips slide. Mention they can go over it. If
  they have questions about the tips slide, email me. Otherwise
  **email Carly**
* Objective:
    * Again, to get them to understand what is going on. We can answer
      the questions if there is time.

# Acivities #

* 3 main groups: one on study 1, one on study 2, one on study 3
    * 20 / 3 = 7 / 2 = ~3-4
    * Two groups will do study 1, two on study 2, two on study 3 (6
      groups total)
    * Give them some time to quickly scan the assignment and develop
      their own concept
          * Time: 5 minutes
    * Group them by counts (1 to 6): 
        * 1, 2 -> study 1
        * 3, 4 -> study 2
        * 5, 6 -> study 3
    * Time: 20 minutes

* Then mix them up again, bringing those from each study into one
  group to merge findings and teach each other.
    * This tutorial:
        * Hand out blank pieces of paper to develop concept
        * Mention I would like to collect them at end, to help me
          improve whether I am doing this right
    * Group by counting:
        * In each group that did study {1,2,3} -> 1 to 6
    * Assign a speaker
    * Assign someone who develops the concept model
    * Time: 25 minutes
    
* Discussion time, all speakers talk about their concept. Write on
  VUE
    * What does it all mean? Any questions? Thoughts?
    * Go over the example questions if there is time.

* Get feedback from the three students (positive + improvement)
