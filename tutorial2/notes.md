# Goals + objectives for second tutorial #

* Get to know two or three students
* Go over the first tips slide
* Objective:
    * "To get the students to develop the concept underlying the
      two studies and how they fit together"

# Acivities #

* 2 groups: one on study 1, one on study 2
    * Each group is composed of pairs who work together to discuss and
      understand what is going on and what it means (16/2 ~= 8/2 ~= 4
      pair-groups working on a single study)
    * Hand out blank pieces of paper to develop concept (collect at end)
    * Give them about 5 minutes to develop their own concept on the
      piece of paper
      * Time: 5 minutes
      * Each person develops it at same time, so they each have a copy
    * Then, group them by counts (1 to 4): 1 and 2 are study 1; 3 and
      4 are study 2
    * Time: 15 minutes

* Then, those who worked on study 1 go with those who worked on study
  2, so that each teaches the other about their study
    * Each group has ~= 4 people, 2 from each study (16/4 ~= 4 groups)
    * Assign a speaker
    * Assign someone who develops the concept model
    * Group by those in study one = count 1 to 4. Those in study two =
      count 5 to 8.
          * All those who had 1 go with those with 5, 2 with 6, etc.
    * Time: 15 minutes
    
* Discussion time, all speakers talk about their concept. Write on
  chalk board or on VUE
    * What does it all mean? Any questions? Thoughts?
    * Go over the example questions if there is time.
