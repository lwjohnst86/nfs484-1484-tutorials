# Study 1

Six week old rats were fed standard chow for 7 days and then,
following an overnight fast, were force fed either a low starch, long
chain triglyceride diet (LCT) (70% fat as corn oil), a low starch,
medium chain triglyceride diet (MCT) (70% fat as medium chain
triglycerides), or a high carbohydrate diet (HC) (70% carbohydrate)
for 12 hours. For the rats on the HC diet, carbohydrate was provided
either as sucrose or $\alpha$-methylglucoside, a non-metabolizable
sugar. Following sacrifice, jejunal lactase mRNA levels were measured,
and lactase activity.

# Study 2

Six week old rats were fed either the LCT diet, the MCT diet, or a
high starch diet (HS) (70% of energy as starch) for 7 days. In order
to estimate the absolute rate of synthesis of lactase, the rats were
given an i.v. infusion of [$^3$H]-phenylalanine 30 minutes prior to
sacrifice. The jejunum was then removed and the incorporation of the
[$^3$H]-phenylalanine was measured by standard methods. Lactase activity
and mRNA levels were also measured.

# Question 1a

Q: Describe the effects of the diets in study 1 on lactase mRNA levels
and lactase activity (2/20).

\pause

E.g. A: Rats on the sucrose diet had significantly greater abundance
of jejunal lactase mRNA (fig 1) and lactase activity (fig 2) compared
to the other three groups.  All other groups were not significantly
different from each other.

# Question 1b

Q: Describe the effects of the diets in study 2 on lactase rate of
synthesis, activity, and mRNA levels (3/20).

\pause

E.g. A:  Rats on a HS diet had a significantly greater rate of lactase
synthesis (Figure 3), had greater lactase activity and greater
relative abundance of lactase mRNA (Both table 1) compared to the other
groups.  Both lipid groups had similar lactase synthesis (fig 3) and
abundance of mRNA (table 1).  The MCT group had a signficantly greater
lactase activity than the LCT group, but less than the HS group (table
1).

# Question 2

Q: Discuss a comprehensive mechanism, supported by the data provided,
which would explain the effects of the differing diets on lactase
regulation (15/20).

\pause

Break it down:

* Acute sucrose (glucose and fructose) ingestion (study 1) appears to
  increase lactase mRNA synthesis (fig 1) and activity (fig 2), while
  the lipids and non-metabolizable CHO do not

\pause

* Chronic HS (glucose) diet (study 2) appears to increase lactase
  enzyme protein synthesis (fig 3) and activity (table 1), and mRNA
  abundance (table 1)

# Question 2, con't

* Chronic MCT diet (study 2) appears to increase lactase activity
  (table 1), though not as much as HS

\pause

* Therefore, HS (likely glucose), has an effect on lactase at the
  transcriptional and post-transcriptional level both acutely and
  chronically, likely mediating its effects at the gene level

* While chronic MCT has a post-translational effect on lactase

# Question 2, con't

E.g. A: Lactase mRNA expression and enzyme activity are regulated
acutely by metabolizable sugar (sucrose).  Chronic intake of
metabolizable CHO (starch) regulates lactase mRNA, enzyme production,
and activity.  Both surcose and starch contain glucose, since glucose
initiates an insulin response, either glucose or insulin may be
mediating the lactase effect.  Chronic exposure to MCT diets stimulate
lactase activity, but not acute exposure, but does not stimulate mRNA
expression or enzyme production.  Therefore, MCT effects lactase activity
post-translationally
