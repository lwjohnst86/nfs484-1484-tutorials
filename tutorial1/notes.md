# Goals + objectives for first tutorial #

* Introductions
* Discuss the assignments + exams (tips slide)
* Discuss goal of tutorials and expectations of students
    * Goal: "To prepare you for the assignment and exams by working
      thro and discussing practice problem sets, which is aimed at
      developing your ability to take data, see what is going on based
      PURELY on the data, interpret it, then bring in your knowledge
      and experience."
    * Expectations: "Go thro the practice problem sets assigned for
      each tutorial so you can come and have a thorough discussion of
      how to think about and work thro the problems."
* Go over components of research
    * Hypothesis, design, collect, analyze, interpret, assimilate with
      previous knowledge

# Acivities #

* Whole group go over what are components of research (name off the components)

* Break up into groups, each doing one component and discuss important
  aspects of it (~20 students = 20/5 topics = 4 students/topic)
      * Design: controls, within vs between, epidemiological, RCTs,
        advantages, disadvantages, who are the groups
      * Collection: Validity, accuracy, reliability, what is trying to
        be measured
      * Analyze: Statistics, comparison groups, significance
      * Interpretation: How to interpret, what does statistics mean in
        context of interpreting
      * Assimilation: Combine with previous knowledge

# Thoughts on how tutorial went #

* 2014-09-16: I thought the first tutorial went well. I felt like I
  rambled a bit at the start but by the end I was better.  I also
  mentioned some things regarding last year that probably weren't
  important for this year.  I also was a bit disorganized with
  assigning groups and assigning topics to groups.
  - Thing to improve: Be more organized for future tutorials,
    especially with assigning groups and topics.
