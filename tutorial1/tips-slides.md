## Tips on completing the assignments and tests ##

* **First and foremost:** Make sure to leave your previous knowledge
  behind when starting the assignment/exams
      * If you trained more clinically, leave that behind
      * If you trained more in basic science, leave that behind
      * Etc.

* Try to think only about what the assignment/exam is giving in the
  background and tables/figures

* Example: Exam mentions only heart disease and Aboriginal populations
  (genetics)... Only discuss those two aspects unless the exam asks otherwise.

## Tips, con't ##

* Keep it neat!

* Don't include p-values, just direction of effect
    * Optionally, include whether it is significant or not

* Don't need detailed knowledge of mechanisms, assignment/exam is meant to
  be generally/fairly self-contained
      * BUT! You still need to know how to think about mechanisms!
      * PLUS! We expect a certain level of knowledge given this is a
        fourth/graduate level course.

* Tables/figures, read legend first as it will contain important info

## Tips, con't ##

* Provide concrete answers and justification

* Marks are **not** based on number of bullet points

* Can use short-hand (e.g. for greater use ">", for increase use
  "$\uparrow$", etc.)

* "No change" is just as important as "change"

* **Everything included is intentional**

## Tips, con't ##

* Laboratory methods are assumed to be the best for that situation

* If animal studies, effect assumed to be same in humans

* When referencing data from a study, indicate where it came from
  (e.g. "X was greater than Y (Figure 1)", etc.)

* We mark on a question-by-question basis (not
  assignment-by-assignment), so repeating what you wrote from previous
  questions is **highly** encouraged, if not necessary for full marks!

## Tips, con't ##

* Difference between increase/decrease and greater/lesser
    * Increase or decrease can only be stated when the experiment is
      over time and the comparison group is at time zero (baseline)
    * Greater or lesser can only be stated when the experiment does
      **not** have a comparison group at time zero (baseline) and does
      compare to other groups

* In final discussion questions that ask about interpreting data from
  multiple studies in the assignment, you can say "... in Study 1,
  these were found..." rather than "... in Figure 1 of Study 1, these
  were found.."
