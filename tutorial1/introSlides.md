# Tips on completing the assignments

* Keep it neat

* Don't include p-values, just direction and whether significant or
  not

* Don't need much knowledge of mechanisms, assignment/exam is meant to
  be generally self-contained

* Provide concrete answers, and justification

* Marks aren't always based on number of bullet points

* Can use short-hand in midterm/final *only* (e.g. for greater use ">",
  for increase use "$\uparrow$", etc.)

* **Everything included is intentional**

# Tips, con't

* Methods are assumed to be the best for that situation

* If animal studies, effect assumed to be same in humans

* No change is just as important as change

* Tables/figures, read legend first as it will contain important info

* Difference between increase/decrease and greater/lesser

* When referencing data from a study, indicate where it came from
  (e.g. "X was greater than Y (Figure 1)", etc.)

* In final discussion questions that ask about interpreting data from
  multiple studies in the assignment, you can say "... in Study 1,
  these were found..." rather than "... in Figure 1 of Study 1, these
  were found.."
