# NOTES FROM FIRST MEETING

## Tutorial 1:

### Advice for TA

* Bring everyone all close together if it is a big classroom.
* Structure the tutorial around going through the background and data
  and understanding it, then split up into groups and work through
  questions using the new understanding of the data
* Good to give analogies/examples whenever possible
* Emphasize what is important to know for completing the assignments
* Outline objectives of tutorial
* Maybe work through study tutorials/assignments on chalk board?
* When working through assignments, go through the step-by-step
  process behind choices and the mechanisms
* Ask the students obvious questions initially in the first few
  classes to ease some potential tension
* Ask specific students questions, but warn them before hand that you
  will be doing this
* Hold their hand through the process of assignment, especially
  initially
* Maybe define some of the concepts/terms such as transcriptional vs
  post-translational
* If students are going to be asking questions about the assignment,
  tell them to go to the discussion board on Blackboard where we will
  answer them there
* Start with showing them how to diagram the mechanisms and what is
  going on, then as the classes progress, use the chalk board to draw
  first start drawing it out, then getting the students to say what
  else needs to be included
* (Advice from Julie Mason) Don't go over the questions in the
  tutorials, but rather go through the background and the data and try
  to understand what it means.  In this way, what ever the question,
  the students are then able to answer them because they understand
  the data.
* When marking, make sure to write down major issues students are
  dealing with in the exam/assignment, so that we can identify how to
  help them deal with it.
* Focus on developing conceptual framework first, without the students
  previous skills, knowledge, and other "baggage". For instance, those
  from a clinical background need to forget about their background and
  their knowledge for the initial entry into the assignment/test.
  Then as the exam moves along, incorporate past knowledge.
* Try to get the students to learn when to **not** use past knowledge
  and when to draw upon it.
  
### What to tell students

* If I can't answer your questions, I will find out and next tutorial
  tell you
* No need to include p-values, just indicate the direction and
  significance
* Don't need detailed knowledge of mechanisms, everything that you
  should need to know we give you; the document is supposed to be a
  standalone piece.  Use only what is provided in the initial part of
  the exam.  As you answer more questions, you can and should
  incorporate more of your past knowledge
* For all people, whether in public health or science or whatever, you
  need to have a solid understanding of the mechanisms and to be able
  to interpret them.
* The purpose of this course is to help you go from taking statistical
  language and converting it into interpretation and application
* You need to provide concrete answers (e.g. yes/no) to the questions, with
  justifications on why you chose that answer
* Marks are not always based on 1 mark per bullet point
* Repeat this: Anything included is intentional
	* Nothing is extraneous
	* Likely we want you to use that information somehow
	* Try to address every bit of information and direction from the
       assignments
* Methods included in the assignments are assumed to be the best for
  that particular study/purpose
* If there are animal studies, it is assumed that the effect is the
  same in humans (unless we explicitly state this)
* Significance and non-significance are important, change and no
  change are important
* There is a difference between greater magnitude of difference and
  increased/decreased; the latter usually indicates change over time,
  while the former is a comparison
* When reading tables and figures, look to the legend first; there is
  always going to be important information in the legend that will
  help with interpreting the tables/figures
* Use shorthand for greater, lesser, equal, increase, decrease, etc
  using > < =

## Tutorial 2

### Advice for TA

### What to tell students

* Use sticky notes when working on the assignment/exam


## Tutorial 3

### Advice for TA

* Will not be able to get through whole assignment
* Giving the students this assignment as a resource
* Purpose is to get them thinking and prepared to answer questions
	* i.e. to use the background information and the biology that has
       been outlined, and to include them into the answers
	* Draw out study design, mention it is helpful for the students
* Get students to come with the assignment already completed, have
  them work with one or two other students, comparing answers.  Then
  share with the class and discuss the answers with everyone.
