# Goals + objectives for fourth tutorial #
  
* Get to know three students
    * What is your favorite genre of anything?
    * What do you find most enjoyable about winter?
    * Road bike or mountain bike? Or neither?
* Try to use their names in the class if they ask a question
* Only doing 2 studies this time, quickly thro describe, doing
  questions this time
* Three options, do practice set:
    * Both studies as one group
    * 1st study in groups, 2nd as one
    * 1st study as one, 2nd in groups
    * I am slightly partial to going through all of it as one group to
    show you how I would do it, what we are looking for, etc. Then we
    can try these approaches for next tutorial as multiple groups.
* Explain why I have done group work in last tutorials --- let
  everyone have a voice, those who don't enjoy speaking in front of
  the whole group can speak in smaller group.  Relate to me personally
  (ie. in past I didn't like talking in front of everyone).
* Could do groups again for next tutorial after showing you these
  slides?

# Acivities #

* Activities will depend on group decision.
* If group work is decided:
    * As usual, count 1 to 4, group by number
    * Everyone does one study
* For all class discussion: Make sure that everyone can talk.
    * Walk thro diagram, how this was what I was wanting to do last
    class, but not enough time
    * At each slide, get them to say what is key points (in background)
    * At the describe questions, get them to quickly tell me what is
    going on
    * At the diagram slide, tell them this is useful and for next
    tutorial we will try to do that as groups.
    * At the mechanism Q, tell them "From the very start, basically
    repeat what you wrote in the previous questions"
    * Mention that high-fat in basic science talk = **high calorie**
    * At Q3: Use the diagrams you made from the background and compare
    to the diagram from study 1. Let that guide you in your answer.
        * Break the question down into manageable pieces
* Get feedback from the three students (positive + improvement)

# Thoughts on how tutorial went #

I thought this tutorial went fairly well.  The students liked me going
through the studies, talking about how it works and how to answer
them.  While some seemed bored/lost, many mentioned they thought it
was useful.  So for next tutorial I will do something similar for next
tutorial.  One thought I had for doing one of the tutorials is to get
them into groups, have them work away at each of the questions (doing
the whole assignment), time them, then get a speaker from each group
to describe what they found and we will compare to the possible
answers we have.  That way it mimics the exam, allows group work, +
class discussion/comparing to potential answers.

Some feedback from the students were:

> "Liked me going through the answers, describing tips on how to
> answer them" (This was basically repeated three times)

> "It went by too fast" "Too quick, couldn't keep up with all of the
> answers" (basically the third student said the same thing)
