# Goals + objectives for fourth tutorial #
  
* Get to know three students
    * 
    * 
    * 
* Give out ticket out the door; need to complete it to leave.
    * Helps us (me) to get better, find out what works, what doesn't
      work.
* Try to use their names in the class if they ask a question
* Do first tips slide before going into groups.
* Will do small groups + class discussion
    * Explain why we are still going to do groups:
        - Eventually they will need to work in a group for final grad assignment
        - Doing groups now will help all of you get comfortable with
          each other, enough to hopefully be able to work with anyone
          in this room.
        - I will be forming the groups for the final assignment
          (depending on attendance)... It will be random (using
          cards [^cards]).  This is how it is often like in the "real" world so
          you have to learn to work without each other's strengths and
          weaknesses, learning to delegate tasks.
        - The groups will be approximately the same size as how we do
          it in the tutorial... One MSc to 3 or 4 MPH students.  To
          get different perspectives, strengths, and weaknesses.
* Goal: To get them to quickly form groups and answer the questions.
  To get them to work together to answer the questions.  Get them to
  delegate tasks (speaker[^sp] and a person to "officially" write down
  answers)

[^cards]: I will probably use cards to randomize people.  I'll use the
    suit of the card to determine group.  Given the small number of
    MSc/PhD students, likely they will form the basis of the groups
    (ie. there will be only four cards for the four grad students).
    Then I will give out the cards and each card will dictate the
    group.

[^sp]: Explain that the speaker is the "official" person to do the
    talking. Anyone can talk but the speakers are the ones that need
    to talk their results.  I may not have them assign speakers. 

# Acivities #

* Split into groups, complete as many questions as they can in 20
  minutes.
* After that we will go over each of the questions.
    * Go over the possible answers to the questions
    * Ask how they did with their own answers, what was different,
      etc.
* Hand out and get back the tickets out the door (5min before end of class)
