# Goals + objectives for seventh tutorial #
  
* Get to know three students
    * 
    * 
    * 
* Try to use their names in the class if they ask a question
* Split into groups before doing tips slide.
* Use cards to randomize into groups (based on suit), using the 4
  MSc/Phd students as the base.
* Will do small groups + class discussion
    * Explain why we are still going to do groups:
* Goal: To get them to quickly form groups and answer the questions.
  To get them to work together to answer the questions.  Get them to
  delegate tasks (speaker[^sp] and a person to "officially" write down
  answers)

[^sp]: Explain that the speaker is the "official" person to do the
    talking. Anyone can talk but the speakers are the ones that need
    to talk their results.  I may not have them assign speakers. 

# Acivities #

* Split into groups right away
* Go through study description with everyone, then at first question,
  get them to do (5min).
* After first question, go over the answers/concept map.
* Repeatedly do: introduce questions, get them to try, then go over answers.
    * Ask how they did with their own answers, what was different,
      etc.

# Thoughts on how tutorial went #

I thought that this tutorial format worked well.  It got some good
feedback. I'll continue using this approach.

I could have been a bit more smooth in transitions.  I've gotten think
of some better ways to talk through the study details.  I don't mind
having them read it, though it is a bit abrupt.

Feedback from the students:

> "Like this format best this tutorial, going question-by-question
> first as individual groups, than going over the answers all
> together"

> "Liked doing it this way"

Improvement:

> "Having the background info would be very helpful to understand the
> practice sets"

> "Going over the describe questions all together than do the
> discussion questions as individual groups... After which going over
> the answers all together"
