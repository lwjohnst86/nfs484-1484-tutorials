# Tips: Some brief background #

What is glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)?

. . .

Glycogenolysis

* Glucose-6-phosphate --(G6Pase)--> glucose

. . .

What is para-Nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPase)?

* In the study, PNPase is a control that does not get influenced by
  refeeding

# Tips: Eugylcemic hyperinsulinemic clamp #

Eu = constant, hyper = increased

1. Infuse a set amount of insulin into vein
2. Infuse glucose into vein and adjust glucose infusion to maintain
   blood glucose at normal levels (approx. 5mM)
3. Measure how much glucose had to be infused to keep blood glucose
   normal

. . .

**By design**, blood glucose doesn’t change, but blood insulin levels
are very high.

What are clamps trying to measure/determine?

. . .

Assess insulin resistance...less glucose infused --> more insulin
resistant (cellular uptake less) at any given insulin level.

# Study 1 #

* The objective of this study was to determine the effect of refeeding
  food-deprived rats on hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)
  activity.
* Rats were food-deprived for 48hrs and then given free access to food
  for 0, 90, 180 or 360 minutes.
* At each time point, plasma was obtained for glucose and insulin
  measurements and liver samples removed for enzyme determination. In
  addition to G6Pase, paprnitrophenyl-phosphatase (PNPase) activity
  was monitored as a control for the G6Pase measurement.

# Study 1, con't #

* To determine whether changes in glucose or insulin were mediating
  the effects of refeeding on hepatic G6Pase activity, a euglycemic,
  hyperinsulinemic clamp experiment was performed.
* Food-deprived rats were fitted with catheters in the carotid artery
  and jugular vein for blood sampling (artery) and glucose and insulin
  infusions (vein).
* Rats were perfused with predetermined doses of insulin and then
  variable doses of glucose were administered in order to maintain
  normal blood glucose levels.
* Fifty minutes after commencement of the infusion, liver samples were
  removed for G6Pase determination.

# Question 1a #

Describe the differences in blood glucose and insulin associated with
refeeding the food-deprived rats (Table 1) (2).


| Time | Glu (mmol/L) | Ins (pmol/L) |
|------+--------------+--------------|
|    0 | 6.3+/-0.6    | 83+/-14      |
|   90 | 11.1+/-0.7*  | 366+/-54     |
|  180 | 10.1+/-1.1*  | 331+/-56*    |
|  360 | 9.2+/-0.8*   | 345+/-41*    |

# Question 2 #

Using the data provided, discuss the relative contributions of hepatic
and dietary carbohydrate to plasma glucose levels observed over the
time course monitored (7).

**Possible answer:**

. . .

> * G-6-Pase activity decreases significantly by 180 & 360 minutes,
  while blood glucose & insulin levels continue to rise during this
  time. We would expect this since a supply of glucose from the food
  reduces the amount that the body needs to supply endogenously from
  the liver

# Question 2, con't #

> * Illustrates the shift from the metabolic state seen in the
  post-absorptive or fasted state, to the metabolic state of a fed
  animal

> * PNPase is just a housekeeping enzyme.

# Question 3 #

Describe the major outcomes of the euglycemic clamp study (Table 2) (2). 

| Ins in | Glu in       | Glu start       | Glu end         | Ins           | G6Pase           |
|--------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+------------------|
| Saline | --------     | 6.4 $\pm$ 0.2   | 6.8 $\pm$ 0.2   | 97 $\pm$  7   | 12.0 $\pm$  0.8  |
|    240 | 11 $\pm$  1  | 6.4  $\pm$  0.1 | 7.1  $\pm$ 0.2  | 221 $\pm$ 8   | 10 $\pm$  0.4    |
|    480 | 18 $\pm$  2  | 6.7  $\pm$ 0.5  | 6.8 $\pm$  0.2  | 324  $\pm$ 29 | 11.3 $\pm$ 0.7   |
|    960 | 35  $\pm$ 1  | 6.0  $\pm$ 0.4  | 6.9 $\pm$  0.5  | 704 $\pm$  94 | 12.1  $\pm$  1.2 |

|  28800 | 49 $\pm$  2  | 5.9  $\pm$  0.4 | 6.5  $\pm$  0.8 | >1400         | 13.6 $\pm$  0.3  |

# Question 4 #

Discuss whether G6Pase activity is predominantly regulated by dietary
carbohydrate or hormonal factors (8).  (Hint: Does insulin (hormone)
or glucose (diet) change G6Pase?)

# Concept map #

# Question 4 #

**Possible answer:**

. . .

> * Feeding increased glucose & insulin (Table 1)
> * After the increase in glucose and insulin, G6Pase activity drops
  (Figure 1)
> * This drop in G6Pase is likely due to changes in glucose since
  changes in insulin have no effect on G6Pase activity

# Tip: Brief background #

What is phosphofructokinase-I (PFK-I)?

. . .

Glycolysis

* Fructose-6-Phosphate --(PFK-I)--> Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate --> ATP
  generation (glucose metabolism)

# Study 2 #

* The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of
  dietary restriction and subsequent weight loss on
  phosphofructokinase-I (PFK-I) activity in selected skeletal and
  heart muscles.

* Fifty-five female rats were separated into 3 groups for 10 weeks of
  dietary restriction.

    1. AL = ad libitum fed (no restriction)
    2. MR = moderate restriction (weight reduced to 81% of AL)
    3.  SR = severe restriction (weight reduced to 63% of AL).

# Study 2, con't #

* During the last week of the study, a measurement of the animal’s
resting oxygen uptake was taken in order to estimate total oxygen
consumption associated with energy metabolism.

* The rats were then killed and the PFK-1 activity in the heart and
various skeletal muscles was determined using standardized techniques.

# Question 1 #

absolute and relative terms) for the AL, MR, and SR groups (Table 1,
Figure 2)(3).

|                  | Wgt (g) - AL | Wgt (g) - MR    | Wgt (g) - SR |

muscles caused by dietary restriction (Table 2)(2).

# Question 2 #

Discuss a mechanism to explain the effects of dietary restriction on
substrate utilization in skeletal muscle (10).

**Possible answer:**

. . .

> * Table 1: Caloric restriction causes a drop in body weight
> * Figure 1: Calorically restricted rats have decreased metabolism
  (measured from resting O2 uptake) but this effect is totally
  accounted for by the loss in body weight (there is no significant
  difference between groups when data is normalized for body
  weight --> expressed in relative terms)
> * Table 2: Skeletal muscle PFK-1 activity drops with caloric
  restriction (but not heart PFK-1)

# Question 2, con't #

> * Total oxidative activity hasn't changed (fig. 1) but glycolysis is
  decreased (decrease PFK-1)
> * Decreased energy intake leads to decreased PFK-1 activity and
  therefore decreased glucose use
> * The animals are most likely mobilizing fat from adipose tissue for
  fuel and some protein

# Question 3 #

What other enzyme/metabolites would you want to measure to verify the
PFK-I enzyme effect, and why? (5)

**Possible answers:**

. . .

* Any enzymes/metabolites in glycolytic pathway
* Any enzymes/metabolites in beta-oxidation to confirm increased use
  of fat for fuel
